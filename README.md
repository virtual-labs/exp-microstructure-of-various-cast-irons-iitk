### About the Experiment 

Referring to the iron-carbon phase diagram of the previous virtual lab (experiment 6), Cast iron is primarily composed of iron (Fe) with a significant proportion of carbon (C > 2.1 wt.%) and other alloying elements. The microstructure of cast iron is typically characterized by the presence of graphite flakes or nodules embedded in the ferrite matrix and/or cementite. Depending on the processing parameters, the microstructure can vary significantly, leading to different types of cast iron, including grey iron, white iron, and ductile iron.
