      "question": "1. Which kind of heat treatment is required for making a harder material.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Annealing",
        "b": "Quenching",
        "c": "Both options are true",
        "d": "None of them are true."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Option A is incorrect since annealing makes a material softer due to slow cooling.  <a href='www.google.com'>here</a>",
        "b": "Option B is correct since Quenching makes a material harder due to faster cooling rates.",
        "c": "Option C is not correct since both heat treatments serve different purposes.",
        "d": "Option D is not correct since the correct answer is Quenching."
